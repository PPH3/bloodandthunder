        <h1>Welocme to the Void align=</h1>
        <p>This is a short list of what I condider to be the best works of weird fiction.
            Reading Lovecraft's essay <i>Supernatural Horror in Literature</i> led me to
            track down and explore some of the obscure works I had not previouly read.
        </p>
        <h2>Story Titles</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melmoth the Wanderer</li>
            <li>Great God Pan</li>
            <li><img src="ggp.jpg" alt="cover of ggp"/></li>
            <li>The Willows</li>
            <li>The Yellow Sign</li>
            <li>The Monk</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Story Selection</h3>
           <p>Lovecraft was something of a horror scholar. For his essay, he conducted
           research that involved studying weird fiction from all across the world
           beginning from ancient times. The survey includes stories from many countries and
           he opines as tho which are the strongest. The titles listed above represent my own 
           preferneces.</p>
